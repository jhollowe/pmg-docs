pmgproxy - Proxmox Mail Gateway API Proxy Daemon
================================================
endif::manvolnum[]

This daemon exposes the whole {pmg} API on TCP port 8006 using
HTTPS. It runs as user `www-data` and has very limited permissions.
Operations requiring more permissions are forwarded to the local
`pmgdaemon`.

Requests targeted for other nodes are automatically forwarded to those
nodes. This means that you can manage your whole cluster by connecting
to a single {pmg} node.

Alternative HTTPS certificate
-----------------------------

By default, pmgproxy uses the certificate `/etc/pmg/pmg-api.pem` for HTTPS
connections.  This certificate is self signed, and therefore not trusted by
browsers and operating systems by default. You can simply replace this
certificate with your own (please include the key inside the '.pem' file).
