Community Support Forum
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{pmg} itself is fully open source, so we always encourage our users to
discuss and share their knowledge using the {forum}. The forum is fully
moderated by the Proxmox support team, and has a quite large user base
around the whole world. Needless to say that such a large forum is a
great place to get information.


Commercial Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{proxmoxGmbh} also offers commercial {pricing-url}[{pmg} Subscription
Service Plans]. System Administrators with a standard subscription
plan can access a dedicated support portal with guaranteed reponse
time, where {pmg} developers help them should an issue appear.  Please
contact the mailto:office@proxmox.com[Proxmox sales team] for more
information or volume discounts.


Bug Tracker
~~~~~~~~~~~

We also run a public bug tracker at
https://bugzilla.proxmox.com. If you ever detect a bug, you can file
an bug entry there. This makes it easy to track the bug status, and
you will get notified as soon as the bug is fixed.
