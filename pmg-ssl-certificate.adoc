SSL certificate
---------------

Access to the administration web interface is always done via
`https`. The default certificate is never valid for your browser and
you always get warnings.

If you want to get rid of these warnings, you have to generate a valid
certificate for your server.

Login to your {pmg} via ssh or use the console:

----
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout key.pem -out req.pem
----

Follow the instructions on the screen, see this example:

----
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]: AT
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:Vienna
Locality Name (eg, city) []:Vienna
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]: Proxmox GmbH
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:Proxmox Mail Gateway
Common Name (eg, YOUR name) []: yourproxmox.yourdomain.com
Email Address []:support@yourdomain.com

Please enter the following 'extra' attributes to be sent with your certificate request
A challenge password []: not necessary
An optional company name []: not necessary
----

After you finished this certificate request you have to send the file
`req.pem` to your Certification Authority (CA). The CA will issue the
certificate (BASE64 encoded) based on your request â€“ save this file as
`cert.pem` to your {pmg}.

To activate the new certificate, do the following on your {pmg}:

----
cat key.pem cert.pem >/etc/pmg/pmg-api.pem
----

Then restart the API servers:

----
systemctl restart pmgproxy
----

Test your new certificate by using your browser.

NOTE: To transfer files from and to your {pmg}, you can use secure
copy: If you desktop is Linux, you can use the `scp` command line
tool. If your desktop PC is windows, please use a scp client like
WinSCP (see https://winscp.net/).


Change Certificate for Cluster Setups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you change the API certificate of an active cluster node, you also
need to update the fingerprint inside the cluster configuration file
`cluster.conf`. It is best to edit that file on the master node.

To show the actual fingerprint use:

----
openssl x509 -in /etc/pmg/pmg-api.pem -noout -fingerprint -sha256
----
