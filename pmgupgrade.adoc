This is a small wrapper around `apt-get dist-upgrade`. We use this to
print additional information (kernel restart required?), and
optionally run an interactive shell after the update. This binary is
invoked when starting an upgrade using the web GUI.

If you are already logged in on the console, it is peferable to invoke
`apt-get` directly.
