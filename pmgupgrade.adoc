This is a small wrapper around `apt full-upgrade`. We use this to print
additional information, like when a node reboot due to a kernel update is
required. Additionally, it can run an interactive shell after the update, this
is used when starting an upgrade using the web GUI.

If you are already logged in on the console, it is preferable to invoke
`apt` directly.
