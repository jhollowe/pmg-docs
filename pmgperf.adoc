Proxmox Simple Performance Benchmark
====================================

This tool tries to gather some CPU/Hardisk performance data on the
hardisk (mounted at 'path').

* CPU BOGOMIPS: bogomips sum of all CPUs

* REGEX/SECOND: regular expressions per second (perl performance
  test), should be above 300000

* HD SIZE: harddisk size

* BUFFERED READS: simple HD read test. Modern HDs should reach at
least 40 MB/sec

* AVERAGE SEEK TIME: tests average seek time. Fast SCSI HDs reach
values < 8 milliseconds. Common IDE/SATA disks get values from 15 to
20 ms. SSD seek times should be below 1ms.

* FSYNCS/SECOND: value should be greater than 200 (you should enable
'write back' cache mode on you RAID controller - needs a battery
backed cache (BBWC)).

* DNS EXT: average time to resolve an external DNS name

* DNS INT: average time to resolve a local DNS name
