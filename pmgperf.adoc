pmgperf - Proxmox Simple Performance Benchmark
==============================================

The command line tool `pmgperf` tries to gather some general
performance data. This is mostly useful for debugging and to identify
performance bottlenecks. It computes the following metrics:

[horizontal]
CPU BOGOMIPS:: bogomips sum of all CPUs

REGEX/SECOND:: regular expressions per second (perl performance
  test), should be above 1000000.

HD SIZE:: harddisk size

BUFFERED READS:: simple HD read test. Modern HDs should reach at
least 100 MB/sec

AVERAGE SEEK TIME:: tests average seek time. Fast SCSI HDs reach
values < 8 milliseconds. Common IDE/SATA disks get values from 15 to
20 ms. SSD seek times should be below 1ms.

FSYNCS/SECOND:: value should be greater than 200 (you should enable
'write back' cache mode on you RAID controller - needs a battery
backed cache (BBWC)).

DNS EXT:: average time to resolve an external DNS name

DNS INT:: average time to resolve a local DNS name

Here is an example output generated by the tool:

----
# pmgperf
CPU BOGOMIPS:      16759.60
REGEX/SECOND:      1186304
HD SIZE:           60.78 GB (/dev/sda1)
BUFFERED READS:    209.84 MB/sec
AVERAGE SEEK TIME: 1.24 ms
FSYNCS/SECOND:     2198.79
DNS EXT:           35.69 ms
DNS INT:           1.41 ms (yourdomain.tld)
