Include the shipped config-snippet in the virtualhost you wish to serve
the documentation from:

```
Include /etc/apache2/conf-available/pmg-docs.conf
```

If pmg-docs is the only vhost on the host you can also globally enable
the config-snippet:

# a2enconf pmg-docs.conf

in both cases reload apache2 afterwards
# systemctl reload apache2

Now you should be able to access the documentation at:

* Admin Guide and Manual pages
http://your-server/pmg-docs

* API Viewer
http://your-server/pmg-docs/api-viewer
