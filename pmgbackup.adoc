{pmg} includes the ability to backup and restore the
configuration. This includes the complete config from `/etc/pmg/`, the
mail filter rules and the statistic database.

NOTE: The backup does not include the network setup, and also no mail
data from the postfix queue or the spam or virus quarantine.

Backups can be created locally or stored on a
https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-backup-server[Proxmox Backup Server]
instance.

Local Backups
-------------

You can create a backup by simply pressing the 'Backup' button in the 'Local
Backup/Restore' tab on the GUI, or by using the command line interface:

----
# pmgbackup backup
starting backup to: /var/lib/pmg/backup/pmg-backup_2018_01_04_5A4E0436.tgz
backup finished
----

Local backups are stored inside directory `/var/lib/pmg/backup/`. It is
usually best to mount a remote file system to that directory, so that
the resulting backups gets stored remotely.

You can list the contents of that directory with:

----
# pmgbackup list
....
pmg-backup_2017_11_10_5A05D4B9.tgz      17012
pmg-backup_2017_11_13_5A09676A.tgz      16831
pmg-backup_2018_01_04_5A4E0436.tgz      21514
----

Restores are also possible using the GUI or command line, and you can
select what parts you want to restore:

System Configuration::

Basically the contents of `/etc/pmg/`.

Rule Database::

The mail filter rule database.

Statistic::

All statistical data.

For example, you can selectively restore the mail filter rules from an
older backup:

----
# pmgbackup restore --filename pmg-backup_2018_01_04_5A4E0436.tgz --database 
starting restore: /var/lib/pmg/backup/pmg-backup_2018_01_04_5A4E0436.tgz
config_backup.tar: OK
Proxmox_ruledb.sql: OK
Proxmox_statdb.sql: OK
version.txt: OK
Destroy existing rule database
Create new database
run analyze to speed up database queries
Analyzing/Upgrading existing Databases...done
restore finished
----

Proxmox Backup Server
---------------------

In order to backup your {pmg} configuration on a Proxmox Backup Server you
need configure the instance as backup 'remote'. You can then directly create
and restore backups, as well as create a scheduled 'backup job' to run
regular backups.

Remotes
~~~~~~~

ifndef::manvolnum[]
[thumbnail="pmg-gui-pbs-remote.png"]
endif::manvolnum[]


A Proxmox Backup Server remote can be configured using the 'Proxmox Backup
Server' panel in the 'Backup/Restore' menu of the GUI, or by using the
`remote` subcommand of `pmgbackup`.

NOTE: You can use API Tokens in place of a username/password combination.

.Example addition of a Proxmox Backup Server remote with id 'archive'.
----
# pmgbackup proxmox-backup remote add archive --datastore big --server backup.proxmox.com --user 'pmgbackup@pbs!token' --password --fingerprint 09:54:ef:..snip..:88:af:47:fe:4c:3b:cf:8b:26:88:0b:4e:3c:b2
Enter new password: ******
Retype new password: ******
----

The fingerprint is optional, if the certificate of the Proxmox Backup Server
remote is signed by a CA trusted by {pmg}.

Additionally you can configure `prune-settings` for each remote, giving you
flexible control about how many backups should be stored on the Proxmox Backup
Server over a period of time.

.Setting the prune options for the Proxmox Backup Server remote with id 'archive'.
----
# pmgbackup remote set archive --keep-last 3 --keep-daily 14 --keep-weekly 8 --keep-monthly 12 --keep-yearly 7
----

If prune settigns are configured, the backup-group of {pmg} is pruned
automatically after each successful backup.

The public settings are stored in `/etc/pmg/pbs/pbs.conf`, sensitive settings,
like passwords are stored in individual files named after the remote inside
`/etc/pmg/pbs/`:

.Configuration Example (`/etc/pmg/pbs/pbs.conf`)
----
pbs: archive
        datastore big
        server backup.proxmox.com
        fingerprint 09:54:ef:..snip..:88:af:47:fe:4c:3b:cf:8b:26:88:0b:4e:3c:b2
        keep-daily 30
        keep-last 5
        keep-monthly 3
        keep-yearly 5
        username pmgbackup@pbs!token
----

Backup Jobs
~~~~~~~~~~~

ifndef::manvolnum[]
[thumbnail="pmg-gui-pbs-backup.png", big=1]
endif::manvolnum[]

With a configured remote you can create backups using the GUI or the
`proxmox-backup backup` subcommand of the `pmgbackup` CLI tool.

.Creating a new backup on the Proxmox Backup Server remote with id 'archive'.
----
# pmgbackup proxmox-backup backup archive
starting update of current backup state

----

For restoring you can optionally select a particular backup-snapshot to return
to the state of configuration and rules at that time.

On the commandline you can get first a list of available backup snapshots using
the `proxmox-backup list` subcommand:

.Listing available backups from the Proxmox Backup Server remote with id 'archive'.
----
# pmgbackup proxmox-backup list archive
┌────────────┬──────────────────────┬────────┐
│ backup-id  │ backup-time          │   size │
╞════════════╪══════════════════════╪════════╡
│ pmg        │ 2020-11-16T14:03:04Z │ 121910 │
├────────────┼──────────────────────┼────────┤
  ...
└────────────┴──────────────────────┴────────┘
----

.Restoring a specific backup snapshot
----
# pmgbackup proxmox-backup restore archive pmg 2020-11-16T14:03:04Z
starting restore of host/pmg/2020-11-16T14:03:04Z from backup
..snip..
restore finished
----

You can remove a particular snapshot by using the `forget` sub command, this
allows the Proxmox Backup Server to pick it up during garbage collection.

----
# pmgbackup proxmox-backup forget archive pmg 2020-11-16T14:03:04Z
----

TIP: You can configure and access all backup related functionallity on both,
the web interface and the command line interface.

Scheduled Backups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can create a `Schedule` for each remote, to periodically create backups of
your {pmg} - for example to run a daily backup at 03:50:00 with a randomized
delay of 15 minutes each day:

----
# pmgbackup proxmox-backup job create archive --schedule '*-*-* 03:50:00' --delay '15 minutes'
----

The randomized delay can help to prevent load-peaks on the backup server, if
you have multiple backups, which all should start around the same time.

The schedules are `systemd.timer` units.  See the `systemd.time(7)` man page for
details on the time specification used.
