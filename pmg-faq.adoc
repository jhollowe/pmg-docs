NOTE: {pmg} releases before 5.0 are not listed here. As they are all EOL (End

[[faq-upgrade]]
How can I upgrade {pmg} to the next release?::

Minor version upgrades, for example upgrading from {pmg} in version 5.1
to 5.2, can be done just like any normal update, either through the
Webinterface's __Node -> Updates__ panel or through the CLI with:
+
----
apt update
apt full-upgrade
----
+
NOTE: Always ensure you correctly setup the
xref:pmg_package_repositories[package repositories] and only continue with the
actual upgrade if `apt update` did not hit any error.
+
Major version upgrades, for example going from {pmg} 5.4 to 6.0, are
also supported. They must be carefully planned and tested and should
*never* be started without having a current backup ready.
Although the specific upgrade steps depend on your respective setup, we
provide general instructions and advice of how a upgrade should be
performed:
