pmgsubscription - Subscription Management
=========================================
endif::manvolnum[]

{pmg} is free open software, and the company that developed it
(Proxmox Server Solutions GmbH) offers {pricing-url}[support] in many
ways, with different support channel, level and pricing.

The tool `pmgsubscription` is used to handle {pmg}
subscriptions. Please use the GUI or the `set` command to upload a new
key:

----
# pmgsubscription set <key>
----


NOTE: Subscription keys are bound to specific servers ('Server ID'),
so you can use them for exactly one server. Each server needs its own
key.


The `get` command is used to view the current subscription status:

----
# pmgsubscription get
